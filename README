Text-BlockFormatter

The requirement for this module grew from my desire to create a module that
formatted SQL. I've made a couple of false starts on that module (called
SQL::Tidy, naturally), and I've now got something that sort of works, but the
structure is a little unwieldy. What I finally realized today was that I needed
to separate the formatting part of the problem into it's own module.

Right now this just does the dead simple word wrapping task. There's only a
single block, and no columns, but future updates will take care of that. This
is Alpha code until I say otherwise.
